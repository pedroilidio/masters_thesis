  abstract = {We review a recent trend in computational systems biology which aims at using pattern recognition algorithms to infer the structure of large-scale biological networks from heterogeneous genomic data. We present several strategies that have been proposed and that lead to different pattern recognition problems and algorithms. The strenght of these approaches is illustrated on the reconstruction of metabolic, protein-protein and regulatory networks of model organisms. In all cases, state-of-the-art performance is reported.},
