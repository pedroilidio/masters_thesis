% DTI prediction review

%%The interaction attributes may be of any dimensionality, and may as well be
%%unknown for some (often many) instance pairs. When binary interactions are
%%considered (pairs either do or do not interact in any specified way) we
%%frequently find ourselves in a Positive-Unlabeled (PU) scenario \cite{}, where
%%we can only confidently measure the presence of a given phenomena, not its
%%absence, and hence, the instance pairs' interactions can only be said to be
%%positive (actually happening) or unknown.
%%
%%% assumptions must be made what is bipartite, graph stuff, networks
%%
%%Furthermore, as the number of interactions grows with the product of the numbers
%%of interacting instances in each bipartite group, taking all possible
%%interactions into consideration may become unfeasible for larger datasets using
%%standard machine learning algorithms. As a result, many workaround techniques
%%are usually employed to generate negative interaction data, such as considering
%%a random subset of unlabeled data as negative\cite{Zhang_2018, Zitnik_2018,
%%Huang_2021}, selecting the most reliably-non interacting pairs (which depends on
%%estimating the interaction likelihood with semi-supervised methods such as
%%self-learning)\cite{} or even artificially creating new dataset instances when
%%very specific factors are known to be needed for an interaction to occur (namely
%%the chemical-structural characteristics of an enzyme's active site) \cite{}.
%%
%%Despite even using sophisticated deep learning algorithms, these approaches thus
%%fail to take all possible drug-target pairs into consideration.
%%
%%Predictive Bi-Clustering Trees (PBCT) were proposed in 2018 by
%%\cite{Pliakos_2018} to address some of these issues, introducing a new method
%%for growing decision tree-based models from bipartite interaction data. With
%%this method and further optimizations, millions of interactions can be
%%considered in reasonable computation time.
%%
%%% explain decision trees TODO ID3, C4.5, CART?
%%Decision Trees work by recursively partitioning the dataset in chunks with
%%progressively similar labels\cite{Breiman_1984, Quinlan_1996}. They do so by
%%consecutively searching for decision rules in each partition that would split
%%the partition in two. For example, a specific numeric characteristic of our
%%instances being less or greater than a threshold value, or if an instance has
%%one of a specific set of values of a categorical variable. For this study, we
%%mainly focus on numerical instance features, so that each tree node represents a
%%binary split designated by an instance attribute an a threshold value.
%%
%%The main idea behind biclustering trees was to separately search for a split
%%attribute and value on each of the two instance groups, considering all possible
%%thresholds among row instances first (e.g. proteins), and only then processing
%%the column instances attributes (e.g. target drugs features).  \par In 2020, the
%%authors expanded on this concept, building ExtraTrees ensembles of PBCTs
%%\cite{Pliakos_2020} and reporting solid boosts on prediction performance. The
%%authors, however, did not explore other forms of tree ensembles, including the
%%so popular Random Forests proposed by \cite{Breiman_2001}, despite the latter
%%being oftentimes regarded one of the best tree ensemble
%%techniques\cite{Huang_2021, Amasyali_2011, Hall_2003, Banfield_2007}. Hence, in
%%this study we demonstrate how DTI prediction improvements can be achieved with
%%the use of Random Forests of Predictive Bi-Clustering Trees, that we name
%%Biclustering Random Forests, and provide an optimized implementation based on
%%scikit-learn \cite{scikit-learn}, one the most standard libraries for machine
%%learning applications using the Python\cite{python} programming language.
%In 2020, the authors expanded on this concept, building ExtraTrees ensembles of
%PBCTs and utilizing unsupervised neighborhood information to further improve
%the previous results \ref{pliakos, vens, 2020}. The use of unsupervised
%information is based upon continuity assumptions \cite{}, that is, the
%supposition that that similar instances are more likely to interact with
%similar targets. In other words, that interaction probability monotonically
%increases with some similarity measure \ref{pu}.

\section{General overview}


% the problem is common
% machine learning is interesting
% main challenges

The effect a drug molecule has on our organism is tightly associated with the specific microscopic structures it physically and chemically interacts with~\cite{bagherian2020machine,chen2018machine}. The regulatory roles of microRNAs are often mediated by their binding to a defined set of messenger RNAs. The activity of a transcription factor is determined by which genes it is capable of regulating~\cite{faith2007largescale}. The success of a recommendation system depends on its ability to predict a user's preference for a set of items in a catalog~\cite{lu2012recommender}.
%
All those scenarios share the same underlying structure: there are two distinct domains of objects that interact with one another, forming a heterogeneous \emph{bipartite network}~\cite{asratian1998bipartite}.
%
%A bipartite network is a common representation for a multitude of
%phenomena. It consists of two separate groups of instances often representing
%two classes of distinct nature of objects. Each object from one group may
%interact with any of the objects from the other, so that each possible pair of
%objects from distinct groups holds a set of attributes describing their
%interaction.

{MORE STUFF}

Frequently, great importance lies in computationally describing such relationships. For instance, developing new drug molecules is a costly and time consuming process. A large portion of that cost derives from the large \textit{in vitro} screening experiments, extensive clinical trials and {}. Therefore, being able to predict beforehand the interactions in a large dataset of drugs and protein targets holds a remarkable potential to accelerate drug development and reduce its costs, enabling the concentration of financial resources and human expertise to a set of most promising candidates. On the other hand, being able to characterize on a large scale the relationships between microRNAs and genes or other biomolecular entities can greatly aid the understanding of regulatory mechanisms of gene expression, a valuable step towards the discovery and development of new therapies. 

% TODO machine learning
Therefore, it is natural that numerous machine learning algorithms have been proposed to predict interactions in bipartite networks. 
The role of a learning algorithm in this setting is to receive a feature vector describing the heterogeneous pair, and characterize their interaction through a binary label. Additionally, we focus on cases where the input vector can be split into two: one vector representing each interacting entity.

Nonetheless, interaction prediction problems pose unique challenges to machine learning approaches, that we enumerate below.
%Despite their importance, interaction prediction problems pose unique challenges to machine learning approaches, that we enumerate below.
%
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Heterogeneous data:} The input data is often composed of two very dissimilar types of objects, each with its own set of features. As a result, estimators may be required to simultaneously deal with descriptors of very different natures.% Namely, in the drug-target interaction prediction problem, the drug domain is composed of chemical compounds, while the target domain is composed of proteins. Each of those domains has its own set of features, such as the chemical structure of the drug or the amino acid sequence of the protein. The features of each domain are usually of a different nature, and therefore require different types of processing. For instance, the chemical structure of a drug can be represented as a graph, while the amino acid sequence of a protein is a string of characters.
    \item \textbf{High dimensionality:} Due to the intrinsic combinatory nature of this type of problem, the interactions to be processed are usually very numerous, even if the number of training instances in each domain is not that expressive. Specifically, for each new object introduced to the training set, a new interaction could be considered for each training sample in the other domain, rendering the number of interactions to grow quadratically with the number of entities of each type.
    \item \textbf{Knowledge sparsity:} As a consequence of the previous point, no amount of research efforts in characterizing new interactions can keep up with the rate at which possible relationships appear, resulting in a fundamental sparsity of confidently verified interactions.
    \item \textbf{Lack of validated negative annotations:} In many cases, the absence of a relationship between two objects is much harder to validate than its presence. For instance, negative results in biochemical essays asserting molecular interactions can often be caused by a plethora of external experimental factors other than the actual lack of interaction under optimal conditions, unlike positive results that usually imply a successful assay~\cite{chen2018machine,pahikkala2015more}. Furthermore, since positive results are often much more informative, negative results in such interaction characterization settings are naturally less valued in the scientific community, and therefore less likely to be reported. These factors result in a general lack of high-quality negative data in interaction datasets, requiring special considerations from machine learning pipelines that are often overlooked in the literature.
    %\item \textbf{New instances:} validation is delicate
    \item \textbf{Impact on model evaluation:} Two rank-based metrics are mainly used to evaluate the performance of interaction prediction models: the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and the area under the precision-recall curve (AUPR). These metrics are known to assess the performance of a model in different ways, and are often used in conjunction to provide a more comprehensive view.
    However, these differences are not fully clear, and neither is how they are affected by the missing annotations.
    This makes it difficult to interpret why different models are sometimes chosen,
    and to decide which metric to prioritize in each experiment. For instance, AUPR is often recommended for imbalanced scenarios~\cite{}, but metrics similar to AUROC are suggested in interaction prediction contexts~\cite{pahikkala2015more,johnsonlogistic}.
    %which metric to take into account when selecting a model.
    %how are they affected by the particularities of the interaction prediction problem.
    %However, the differences between them are not fully clear, and the choice of which metric to use can have a significant impact on the conclusions drawn from the model's performance.

These issues are an integral part of interaction prediction problems,
%arising from their fundamental definition.
that arise from how they are fundamentally defined around combinations of objects.
%
However, these differences are often overlooked when developing machine learning algorithms.  %~\cite{pahikkala2015more}.
%
%If, in a given bipartite interaction problem, the feature vector characterizing a pair of possibly interacting entities is a simple combination of independent representations of each entity, we can see the training set as two separate design matrices rather than the usual single one, disregarding their combination as a data preprocessing step and leaving the treatment of both in conjunction as a matter of estimator design. This view defines a different machine learning paradigm, in which what we call "instances" or "samples" are not the dyads themselves, but rather each individual interacting object.
%For instance, it is common for the input vector describing each dyad to be a simple concatenation of feature vectors describing each interacting entity.
For instance, it is common to represent each dyad with the concatenated feature vectors of its components. Nevertheless, it can be challenging to collect representations for all dyads in this format, which would result in a very large matrix to be processed by the algorithm.
%
Instead, the training set for a bipartite problem is more naturally represented as two separate design matrices rather than the usual single one.
Ideally, we would want to avoid the combination of feature vectors as a data preprocessing step, leaving the conjoint treatment of both design matrices as a matter of estimator design. This view defines a different machine learning paradigm, in which what we call "instances" or "samples" are not the dyads themselves, but rather each individual interacting object. The estimator receives both feature matrices and it is up to the algorithm to decide how to use them in conjunction to predict new interactions.

% RELATED TERMS section
%one-class classification
%While \emph{link prediction} and \emph{dyadic prediction} are common terms in the literature referring to similar concepts, they are not specific to the presence of two distinct groups of objects nor make clear the presence of describing attributes for both of them (often called \emph{side-features} or \emph{side-information} in the context of recommendation systems). While \emph{interaction prediction} seems a closer alternative,
%usually assuming side-features, % TODO I do not think so
%it is also not concerned with the heterogeneity of the network.
%As an abuse of terminology, we thus refer to this "heterogeneous bipartite interaction prediction" paradigm as \emph{bipartite learning}.
There are two general strategies for developing machine learning algorithms for bipartite interaction prediction. We call them \emph{data-centric} and \emph{estimator-centric} approaches.
%
The majority of methods proposed for bipartite learning is based on organizing the data to enable the use of traditional learning algorithms. These data-centric adaptations can be broadly classified into two categories~\cite{schrynemackers2015classifying,pliakos2018global,pliakos2020drugtarget}, which we describe below.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Global single output:} The most common approach observed in the literature. The dataset is formatted so that each dyad is an instance. Each dyad has a single label associated with it, and the feature vector describing the dyad is the concatenation of the two feature vectors describing the interacting entities.
    Usual single-output learning algorithms can then be applied to the problem.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Main advantage:} Enables the estimator to consider features from both instance domains simultaneously.
        \item \textbf{Main disadvantage:} It can be computationally infeasible to build the feature vectors and train the estimator for all possible interactions.
        %The distinct roles of the two domains are not explicitly considered, and the estimator may not be able to effectively capture the interactions' heterogeneity.
    \end{itemize}
    %This approach is particularly impacted by the aforementioned scalability issues resulting from the large number of possible interactions, which leads many authors towards undersampling negative interactions, likely at the expense of increasing false positives. % TODO: confirm
    \item \textbf{Local multi-output:} This strategy separates the bipartite learning problem into two multi-output tasks.
    We first select one of the domains as input and the other as output. We train a multi-output estimator to receive the features of the input domain and predict its interactions with the output domain. Each instance in the output domain is considered an output to me modeled, so that the features of the output domain are completely disregarded in this step.
    The same procedure is then repeated with the roles of the domains reversed. Predicted interactions of these two models are fed into a new round of training that occurs in a similar fashion. A total of four models is necessary to predict interactions between instances that were both not present in the training set.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Main advantage:} A much smaller number of input samples is considered, in comparison to the global single output approach. As a consequence, the models are usually faster to train.
        \item \textbf{Main disadvantage:} It requires training new models for each new batch of interactions to be predicted. This severely limits the application on online learning settings.
    \end{itemize}
    %While faster to train in general, the application of this approach in online settings is severely hampered by the need to train secondary models for each previously unseen instance.
\end{itemize}

Other methods adapt the learning algorithm itself to take full advantage of the bipartite format. These strategies tend to be more computationally efficient than the global single output approach, since they consider the dataset in a more compact format. Notwithstanding, they are still able to consider both domains simultaneously, unlike the local multi-output procedure. There is, however, a limited number of learning algorithms that can be adapted in a more fundamental level. Notable examples of estimator-centered adaptations are listed below.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Linear regression:} Instance-instance similarities among each domain could be used to build a dyad-dyad similarity matrix. This matrix could then be used as a kernel matrix for training a linear regression model in a global single output fashion. The main problem with this idea is that a dyad-dyad kernel matrix would be often prohibitively large. Kron-RLS~\cite{vanlaarhoven2011gaussian} solves this issue, building the hypothetical linear model we described without explicitly obtaining the dyad-dyad kernel matrix.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Main advantage:} It is a remarkably efficient method.
        \item \textbf{Main disadvantage:} Linear relationships frequently are too simplistic to capture the complexity of the underlying interactions.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Matrix factorization:} The adjacency matrix of the bipartite network is decomposed into two latent feature matrices, one for each domain. The product of these matrices approximates the original adjacency matrix, and can be used to predict new interactions between known instances. \textcite{liu2016neighborhood} introduces a method to extend this idea to predict interactions with new instances, by encouraging instance-instance vicinities to be transfered from the original to the latent feature space.
    % TODO nrlmf uses side info
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Main advantage:} It is a naturally scalable technique, being designed from the ground up for interaction prediction tasks.
        \item \textbf{Main disadvantage:} Interpretability is limited and a large number of hyperparameters are necessary.  % TODO it does not seem too much serious
        % other algorithms were shown to surpass it
    \end{itemize}
    %
    %\item \textbf{Kernel-based methods:} \cite{} demonstrates that a linear regression model can be built as if a dyad-dyad kernel matrix was used (which would be prohibitively large), by instead separately eigendecomposing the two intra-domain kernel matrices. However, while remarkably efficient, linear relationships frequently are too simplistic to capture the complexity of the underlying interactions, displaying limited predictive power.
    \item \textbf{Decision trees:} \cite{pliakos2018predictive} proposes an adaptation to the split search procedure occurring at each decision tree node. The search is performed locally for each domain, similarly to the local multi-output approach, but the resulting model is a single decision tree.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Main advantage:} Better scores are achieved in comparison to decision trees adapted with data-centric approaches~\cite{pliakos2018global}.
        \item \textbf{Main disadvantage:} No improvement in training complexity is observed relative to decision trees under the global single output adaptation.
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

%Interestingly, on a general level, not many options seem to exist when developing machine learning algorithms specifically for this type of problem.
%Interestingly, on the highest level, there seems not to be a staggering variety of general frameworks under which. 
% there is not an expressive variety of algorithms
%%Interestingly, on the highest level, the variety of general frameworks and strategies specifically built under the bipartite paradigm is not staggering. % TODO rephrase
%
%The most common approach is to work with simple combinations of the feature vectors describing the components of each pair (by concatenating them, for example), effectively resetting the problem around the dyad as the primary atomic entity to be labeled. Transformed into a more traditional format, usual machine learning algorithms can then be applied to the problem. This approach, referred to as \emph{global single output} (GSO) by \cite{}, is particularly impacted by the aforementioned scalability issues resulting from the large number of possible interactions, which leads many authors towards undersampling negative interactions, likely at the expense of increasing false positives. % TODO: confirm
%Furthermore, inadvertently sampling out test or validation sets directly from the GSO-transformed data results in feature vectors for individual instances to be shared with the training set, even if dyads themselves are disjoint, 
%raising considerations about the resulting estimates of model generalization~\citep{pahikalla2015}.

% Other strategies, termed \emph{local multi-output} (LMO)~\citep{} involve building separate traditional models for each bipartite domain, considering instances in the unselected domain as feature-less outputs to be modeled. While faster to train in general, the application of this approach in online settings is severely hampered by the need to train secondary models for each previously unseen instance.

% Some interesting proposals modify estimators in a more fundamental way, diverging from the aforementioned strategies by not depending on organizing the bipartite dataset to be processed by a generic traditional algorithm. \cite{} demonstrates that a linear regression model can be built as if a dyad-dyad kernel matrix was used (which would be prohibitively large), by instead separately eigendecomposing the two intra-domain kernel matrices. However, while remarkably efficient, linear relationships frequently are too simplistic to capture the complexity of the underlying interactions, displaying limited predictive power.
% Under the name of \emph{Predictive Bi-Clustering Trees} (PBCT) \cite{pliakos2018predictive}, proposes decision tree-based models to directly tackle bipartite datasets, by localizing to each domain not entire models, as in LMO, but rather the split search procedure occurring at each tree node. Nevertheless, no improvement in training complexity is observed relative to GSO-adapted decision trees.

% Matrix factorization methods are an outcast in this general taxonomy of bipartite algorithms. Common in the context of recommendation systems, they are native to link prediction settings,
% being already successfully applied to bipartite problems. This class of algorithms is based on determining latent feature matrices for each domain, in a way that their matrix product approximates the adjacency matrix formed from the training labels. While originally agnostic to side-information and thus incapable of labeling new instances (what is sometimes referred to as the \emph{cold start} problem), ingenious adaptations have been proposed~\citep{liu} to circumvent this issue by encouraging intra-domain pairwise distances to be a transferable property from the original to the latent feature space~\citep{}.

%Deep learning strategies have been gaining popularity in the last years for problems such as the prediction of drug-target affinities~\citep{} or microRNA-gene interactions~\citep{}. However, they often rely on the same GSO transformation we mentioned before, suffering from the scalability issues we mentioned and often not reporting predictive performance for new instances, only new combinations. Furthermore, the particular lack of interpretability of these models is a long-discussed matter in the scientific literature~\citep{}, and more transparent reasoning supporting the obtained predictions could be an invaluable asset in the advancement of human knowledge, potentially uncovering new insights about underlying molecular dynamics or genetic regulatory mechanisms of various interaction phenomena.

In particular, decision trees are a very interesting option to explore. They show remarkable interpretability, flexibility to different tasks, and straightforward usage, besides demonstrating remarkable predictive power when combined into ensembles~\cite{breiman2001random, whyarebestfortabular}.  % TODO cite more
We list below some of the main advantages of learning algorithms based on decision trees.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Interpretability:} Decision trees and forests are well-known transparent models, with several methods being available to interpret their predictions~\cite{mdi, mdi+, treeshap}. For instance, the frequency with which a feature is used by the tree can reflect its importance in the prediction process~\cite{breiman1984classification}.
    \item \textbf{No need for preprocessing:} In most cases, very little preprocessing is necessary to use decision trees. They can directly handle continuous or categorical features, and natively deal with missing feature values~\cite{xgboost}. They are also not sensible to feature scaling, so normalization is most often not necessary.
    \item \textbf{Flexibility:} Decision trees can be used for both classification and regression tasks, and can handle either single or multi-output problems. They were successfully adapted to a wide range of scenarios including time series forecasting~\cite{}, survival analysis~\cite{}, and unstructured inputs in general~\cite{zhang2017deepforest}.
    \item \textbf{Small number of hyperparameters:}
    They have a small number of hyperparameters in comparison to other algorithms such as deep neural networks, which makes them easy to use and tune. 
    %The most common hyperparameters are the maximum depth of the tree, the minimum number of samples required to split a node, and the minimum number of samples required to be at a leaf node.
    %\item \textbf{Non-parametric:}
    %Decision trees are non-parametric models, meaning they make no assumptions about the underlying distribution of the data. This flexibility allows them to capture complex relationships without being constrained by a specific functional form.
    \item \textbf{Predictive power:} They can uncover complex non-linear relationships between features and labels, while being notably resistant to overfitting when combined into ensembles. They are widely recognized for their predictive performance especially on structured data~\cite{whyarebestfortabular}.
    \item \textbf{Fast inference:} Once trained, they can make predictions in logarithmic time complexity~\cite{breiman1984classification}.
\end{enumerate}

%Whith all these benefits in mind, the main focus of this study is to explore the potential of decision forests for bipartite learning.

Theoretical complexity analysis and empirical results on artificial datasets showing high statistical significance solidly support this result, paving a promising path for the application of bipartite trees to naturally high-dimensional interaction problems.
%     %\item \textbf{Interpretability:} Tree-based models are 
%     \item \textbf{Weighted neighbors prototypes:} Results from the original PBCT paper~\cite{pliakos2018predictive} suggest that when one of the entities composing a pair being predicted is present in the training set, restricting the prototype calculation in the final leaf to the labels of the known instance improves predictive performance. We employ this procedure for the first time in forests of bipartite trees and generalize the idea by exploring several similarity-weighted averages for prototype calculation, showing that quadratic similarity weighting, in particular, significantly outperforms the remaining options when new entities are presented.
%     \item \textbf{Semi-supervised impurities:} Taking the intrinsic large amount of unlabeled data of interaction problems into account, we are the first to explore the use of semi-supervised impurity metrics in the training of bipartite forests, while also proposing an efficient impurity function for kernel matrices, once again acknowledging the scalability concerns of bipartite learning. We show that this modification can significantly improve the model's resilience to unknown interactions by measuring their performance under random masking of positive labels in the training set.

\section{Related work}
\label{sec:related_work}

While early proposals of bipartite algorithms for drug-target interaction prediction already make use of the concept of local models, \cite{schrynemackers2015classifying} seem to be the first to formally define the ideas of the GSO and LMO adaptations of traditional machine learning algorithms. In their study, \cite{schrynemackers2015classifying} analyses the performance of Random Forests~\citep{breiman2001random} (RF) and Extremely Randomized Trees~\citep{geurts2006extremely} (ExtraTrees) adapted in both ways to be applied to DTI prediction, suggesting a greater potential to generalization of ExtraTrees in comparison to RF.

In \citeyear{pliakos2018global}, \cite{pliakos2018global} presents the PBCT algorithm, an original adaptation of decision trees to bipartite scenarios, and demonstrates improved results over the previous, more superficial, adaptations. Although directly considering the bipartite data format, with separate design matrices for each domain, their proposal is still limited by the same asymptotic complexity of GSO-adapted trees.
The authors later extend the PBCT algorithm to ensembles, building bipartite versions of Random Forests and ExtraTrees~\cite{pliakos2019network}. Later still, they explore the use of Neighborhood-Regularized Logistic Matrix Factorization (NRLMF)~\citep{liu2016neighborhood} as a pre-training step to bipartite ExtraTrees, generating continuous pseudo-labels for negative interactions to be inputted to the forest estimator. They demonstrate significant improvements in predictive performance resulting from this procedure~\cite{pliakos2019network}, reinforcing the hypothesized potential of semi-supervised techniques. Nevertheless, the authors refrain from experimenting with random forests, and their bipartite models are still subject to the same training complexity.

\cite{levatic2017semisupervised} and {} independently propose a way to consider semi-supervised assumptions on the level of a decision tree's split search procedure rather than the whole model. They do so by penalizing the selection of split points that separate close training instances, so that instances within the same tree node, that tend to yield the same output, also will now tend to have similar feature vectors. Under the assumption that neighboring instances are more likely to have similar labels (the \emph{smoothness} assumption), delegating part of the split's influence to the feature space directly is expected to reduce the impact of missing or incorrect labels. 

More recently, \cite{alves2023semisupervised} applied a more computationally efficient variant of this idea to bipartite trees, using a semi-supervised evaluation not in every possible split but to choose between the two best supervised splits of each domain at each tree node. The authors, however, do not explore ensembles of bipartite trees or the more expensive semi-supervised evaluation of every candidate split.

In the present work, we thus demonstrate how bipartite trees can be grown faster with a modification of their training procedure. We also apply the original proposal of a semi-supervised split choice criterion to bipartite trees and compare it to the more efficient variant proposed by \cite{alves2023semisupervised}. We also propose an intermediate-complexity approach for kernel features, enabling semi-supervised evaluation of every candidate split while still being faster than the original idea.

\section{Main objectives}

The present work will be centered at the following research questions:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Can bipartite trees be faster?}
    
    Investigate how can we exploit the bipartite nature of the problem to achieve a speedup in the training of decision trees.

    \item \textbf{Are semi-supervised techniques beneficial for bipartite forests?}

    Test the hypothesis that semi-supervised techniques can improve the resilience of bipartite trees to missing annotations.

    \item \textbf{How do AUROC and AUPR differ in their assessment of model performance?}

    Evaluate in detail the differences between the two most common threshold-agnostic metrics for binary classification tasks: the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUROC) and the Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPR).

    \item \textbf{How do bipartite forests compare with proficient models in the field?}

    Compare the performance of bipartite forests with other state-of-the-art models for bipartite learning.

\end{enumerate}
