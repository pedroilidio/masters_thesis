  abstract = {We explore a new approach to shape recognition based on a virtually infinite family of binary features (queries) of the image data, designed to accommodate prior information about shape invariance and regularity. Each query corresponds to a spatial arrangement of several local topographic codes (or tags), which are in themselves too primitive and common to be informative about shape. All the discriminating power derives from relative angles and distances among the tags. The important attributes of the queries are a natural partial ordering corresponding to increasing structure and complexity; semi-invariance, meaning that most shapes of a given class will answer the same way to two queries that are successive in the ordering; and stability, since the queries are not based on distinguished points and substructures.             No classifier based on the full feature set can be evaluated, and it is impossible to determine a priori which arrangements are informative. Our approach is to select informative features and build tree classifiers at the same time by inductive learning. In effect, each tree provides an approximation to the full posterior where the features chosen depend on the branch that is traversed. Due to the number and nature of the queries, standard decision tree construction based on a fixed-length feature vector is not feasible. Instead we entertain only a small random sample of queries at each node, constrain their complexity to increase with tree depth, and grow multiple trees. The terminal nodes are labeled by estimates of the corresponding posterior distribution over shape classes. An image is classified by sending it down every tree and aggregating the resulting distributions.             The method is applied to classifying handwritten digits and synthetic linear and nonlinear deformations of three hundred [Formula: see text] symbols. State-of-the-art error rates are achieved on the National Institute of Standards and Technology database of digits. The principal goal of the experiments on [Formula: see text] symbols is to analyze invariance, generalization error and related issues, and a comparison with artificial neural networks methods is presented in this context.

In this paper we perform a computational analysis of common AUCPR estimators and their confidence intervals. We find both satisfactory estimates and invalid procedures and we recommend two simple intervals that are robust to a variety of assumptions.},

However, when dealing with highly skewed datasets, Precision-Recall (PR) curves give a more informative picture of an algorithm's performance. We show that a deep connection exists between ROC space and PR space, such that a curve dominates in ROC space if and only if it dominates in PR space. A corollary is the notion of an achievable PR curve, which has properties much like the convex hull in ROC space; we show an efficient algorithm for computing this curve. Finally, we also note differences in the two types of curves are significant for algorithm design. For example, in PR space it is incorrect to linearly interpolate between points. Furthermore, algorithms that optimize the area under the ROC curve are not guaranteed to optimize the area under the PR curve.},

Metaphorically, the adaptation allows us to find needles in haystacks in the form of very predictive but rarely seen features. Our paradigm stems from recent advances in stochastic optimization and online learning which employ proximal functions to control the gradient steps of the algorithm. We describe and analyze an apparatus for adaptively modifying the proximal function, which significantly simplifies setting a learning rate and results in regret guarantees that are provably as good as the best proximal function that can be chosen in hindsight. We give several efficient algorithms for empirical risk minimization problems with common and important regularization functions and domain constraints. We experimentally study our theoretical analysis and show that adaptive subgradient methods outperform state-of-the-art, yet non-adaptive, subgradient algorithms.},

Specifically, we first describe the data used in such computational DTI prediction efforts. We then categorize and elaborate the state-of-the-art methods for predicting DTIs. Next, an empirical comparison is performed to demonstrate the prediction performance of some representative methods under different scenarios. We also present interesting findings from our evaluation study, discussing the advantages and disadvantages of each method.

  abstract = {There are various interaction/association bipartite networks in biomolecular systems. Identifying unobserved links in biomedical bipartite networks helps to understand the underlying molecular mechanisms of human complex diseases and thus benefits the diagnosis and treatment of diseases. Although a great number of computational methods have been proposed to predict links in biomedical bipartite networks, most of them heavily depend on features and structures involving the bioentities in one specific bipartite network, which limits the generalization capacity of applying the models to other bipartite networks. Meanwhile, bioentities usually have multiple features, and how to leverage them has also been challenging.In this study, we propose a novel multi-view graph convolution network (MVGCN) framework for link prediction in biomedical bipartite networks. We first construct a multi-view heterogeneous network (MVHN) by combining the similarity networks with the biomedical bipartite network, and then perform a self-supervised learning strategy on the bipartite network to obtain node attributes as initial embeddings. Further, a neighborhood information aggregation (NIA) layer is designed for iteratively updating the embeddings of nodes by aggregating information from inter- and intra-domain neighbors in every view of the MVHN. Next, we combine embeddings of multiple NIA layers in each view, and integrate multiple views to obtain the final node embeddings, which are then fed into a discriminator to predict the existence of links. Extensive experiments show MVGCN performs better than or on par with baseline methods and has the generalization capacity on six benchmark datasets involving three typical tasks.Source code and data can be downloaded from https://github.com/fuhaitao95/MVGCN.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

  abstract = {The area under the ROC curve (AUC) is a very widely used measure of performance for classification and diagnostic rules. It has the appealing property of being objective, requiring no subjective input from the user. On the other hand, the AUC has disadvantages, some of which are well known. For example, the AUC can give potentially misleading results if ROC curves cross. However, the AUC also has a much more serious deficiency, and one which appears not to have been previously recognised. This is that it is fundamentally incoherent in terms of misclassification costs: the AUC uses different misclassification cost distributions for different classifiers. This means that using the AUC is equivalent to using different metrics to evaluate different classification rules. It is equivalent to saying that, using one classifier, misclassifying a class 1~point is p~times as serious as misclassifying a class 0~point, but, using another classifier, misclassifying a class 1~point is P~times as serious, where p{$\neq$}P. This is nonsensical because the relative severities of different kinds of misclassifications of individual points is a property of the problem, not the classifiers which happen to have been chosen. This property is explored in detail, and a simple valid alternative to the AUC is proposed.},

  abstract = {While novel technologies such as high-throughput screening have advanced together with significant investment by pharmaceutical companies during the past decades, the success rate for drug development has not yet been improved prompting researchers looking for new strategies of drug discovery. Drug repositioning is a potential approach to solve this dilemma. However, experimental identification and validation of potential drug targets encoded by the human genome is both costly and time-consuming. Therefore, effective computational approaches have been proposed to facilitate drug repositioning, which have proved to be successful in drug discovery. Doubtlessly, the availability of open-accessible data from basic chemical biology research and the success of human genome sequencing are crucial to develop effective in silico drug repositioning methods allowing the identification of potential targets for existing drugs. In this work, we review several chemogenomic data-driven computational algorithms with source codes publicly accessible for predicting drug--target interactions (DTIs). We organize these algorithms by model properties and model evolutionary relationships. We re-implemented five representative algorithms in R programming language, and compared these algorithms by means of mean percentile ranking, a new recall-based evaluation metric in the DTI prediction research field. We anticipate that this review will be objective and helpful to researchers who would like to further improve existing algorithms or need to choose appropriate algorithms to infer potential DTIs in the projects. The source codes for DTI predictions are available at: https://github.com/minghao2016/chemogenomicAlg4DTIpred.},

  abstract = {With the continuous expansion of data availability in many large-scale, complex, and networked systems, such as surveillance, security, Internet, and finance, it becomes critical to advance the fundamental understanding of knowledge discovery and analysis from raw data to support decision-making processes. Although existing knowledge discovery and data engineering techniques have shown great success in many real-world applications, the problem of learning from imbalanced data (the imbalanced learning problem) is a relatively new challenge that has attracted growing attention from both academia and industry. The imbalanced learning problem is concerned with the performance of learning algorithms in the presence of underrepresented data and severe class distribution skews. Due to the inherent complex characteristics of imbalanced data sets, learning from such data requires new understandings, principles, algorithms, and tools to transform vast amounts of raw data efficiently into information and knowledge representation. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of the development of research in learning from imbalanced data. Our focus is to provide a critical review of the nature of the problem, the state-of-the-art technologies, and the current assessment metrics used to evaluate learning performance under the imbalanced learning scenario. Furthermore, in order to stimulate future research in this field, we also highlight the major opportunities and challenges, as well as potential important research directions for learning from imbalanced data.},

These systems passively track different sorts of user behavior, such as purchase history, watching habits and browsing activity, in order to model user preferences. Unlike the much more extensively researched explicit feedback, we do not have any direct input from the users regarding their preferences. In particular, we lack substantial evidence on which products consumer dislike. In this work we identify unique properties of implicit feedback datasets. We propose treating the data as indication of positive and negative preference associated with vastly varying confidence levels. This leads to a factor model which is especially tailored for implicit feedback recommenders. We also suggest a scalable optimization procedure, which scales linearly with the data size. The algorithm is used successfully within a recommender system for television shows. It compares favorably with well tuned implementations of other known methods. In addition, we offer a novel way to give explanations to recommendations given by this factor model.},

This is in contrast to collaborative filtering with explicit feedback data which aims to model these relationships using explicit signals such as user-item ratings. Since most data on the web comes in the form of implicit feedback data there is an increasing demand for collaborative filtering methods that are designed for the implicit case. In this paper we present Logistic Matrix Factorization (Logistic MF), a new probabilistic model for matrix factorization with implicit feedback. The model is simple to implement, highly parallelizable, and has the added benefit that it can model the probability that a user will prefer a specific item. Additionally, we show it to experimentally outperform the widely adopted Implicit Matrix Factorization method using a dataset composed of music listening behavior from streaming music company Spotify.},

  abstract = {Identifying drug-target interactions through computational methods is raised an important and key step in the process of drug discovery and drug-oriented research during the last years. In addition to the advantages of existing computational methods, there are also challenges that affect methods' efficiency and provide obstacles in the direction of developing these computational methods. However, the literature suffers from lacking a comprehensive and comparative analysis concerning drug-target interactions prediction (DTIP) focusing on the analysis of technical and challenging aspects. It seems necessary to provide a comparative perspective and a different analysis on a macro level due to the importance of the DTIP problem. In this paper, we presented the quadruple framework of analytical, named DTIP-TC2A consists of four main components for DTIP. The first component, categorizing DTIP methods based on the technical aspect ahead and investigating the strengths and weaknesses of different DTIP methods. Second, classify DTIP challenges with a major focus on a well-organized and coherent investigation of challenges and presenting a macro view of the DTIP challenges by systematic identification of them. Third, recommending some general criteria to analyze DTIP methods in form of the proposed classifications. Suggesting a suitable set of qualitative criteria along with using quantitative criteria can lead to a more proper choice of DTIP methods. Fourth, performing a two-phase qualitative analysis and comparison between each class of DTIP approaches based on the proposed functional criteria and the identified challenges ahead in order to understand the superiority of each class of DTIP methods over the other class. We believed that the DTIP-TC2A framework can offer a proper context for efficient selection of DTIP methods, improving the efficiency of a DTIP system due to the nature of computational methods, upgrading DTIP methods by removing the barriers, and presenting new directions of research for further studies through systematic identification of DTIP challenges and purposeful evaluation of challenges and methods.},

  abstract = {Despite more than two decades of continuous development learning from imbalanced data is still a focus of intense research. Starting as a problem of skewed distributions of binary tasks, this topic evolved way beyond this conception. With the expansion of machine learning and data mining, combined with the arrival of big data era, we have gained a deeper insight into the nature of imbalanced learning, while at the same time facing new emerging challenges. Data-level and algorithm-level methods are constantly being improved and hybrid approaches gain increasing popularity. Recent trends focus on analyzing not only the disproportion between classes, but also other difficulties embedded in the nature of data. New real-life problems motivate researchers to focus on computationally efficient, adaptive and real-time methods. This paper aims at discussing open issues and challenges that need to be addressed to further develop the field of imbalanced learning. Seven vital areas of research in this topic are identified, covering the full spectrum of learning from imbalanced data: classification, regression, clustering, data streams, big data analytics and applications, e.g., in social media and computer vision. This paper provides a discussion and suggestions concerning lines of future research for each of them.},

  abstract = {Computational Drug Discovery, which uses computational techniques to facilitate and improve the drug discovery process, has aroused considerable interests in recent years. Drug Repositioning (DR) and Drug-Drug Interaction (DDI) prediction are two key problems in drug discovery and many computational techniques have been proposed for them in the last decade. Although these two problems have mostly been researched separately in the past, both DR and DDI can be formulated as the problem of detecting positive interactions between data entities (DR is between drug and disease, and DDI is between pairwise drugs). The challenge in both problems is that we can only observe a very small portion of positive interactions. In this paper, we propose a novel framework called Dyadic Positive-Unlabeled learning (DyPU) to solve the problem of detecting positive interactions. DyPU forces positive data pairs to rank higher than the average score of unlabeled data pairs. Moreover, we also derive the dual formulation of the proposed method with the rectifier scoring function and we show that the associated non-trivial proximal operator admits a closed form solution. Extensive experiments are conducted on real drug data sets and the results show that our method achieves superior performance comparing with the state-of-the-art.},

Study Design and Setting A simulation study was performed considering different sizes of diseased and nondiseased groups. Values of a biomarker were sampled with various variances and differences in mean values between the two groups. The AUCs and the AUPRCs were examined regarding their agreement and vs. the positive predictive value (PPV) and the negative predictive value (NPV) of the biomarker. Results With a disease prevalence of 50\%, the AUC and the AUPRC showed high correlations with the PPV and the NPV ({$\rho~>~$}0.95). With a prevalence of 1\%, small PPV and AUPRC values ({$<$}0.2) but high AUC values ({$>$}0.9) were found. The AUPRC reflected better than the AUC the discriminant ability of the biomarker; it had a higher correlation with the PPV ({$\rho~$}=~0.995 vs. 0.724; P~{$<~$}0.001). Conclusion In uncommon and rare diseases, the AUPRC should be preferred to the AUC because it summarizes better the performance of a biomarker.},

  abstract = {Drug--target interaction prediction plays an important role in new drug discovery and drug repurposing. Binding affinity indicates the strength of drug--target interactions. Predicting drug--target binding affinity is expected to provide promising candidates for biologists, which can effectively reduce the workload of wet laboratory experiments and speed up the entire process of drug research. Given that, numerous new proteins are sequenced and compounds are synthesized, several improved computational methods have been proposed for such predictions, but there are still some challenges. (i) Many methods only discuss and implement one application scenario, they focus on drug repurposing and ignore the discovery of new drugs and targets. (ii) Many methods do not consider the priority order of proteins (or drugs) related to each target drug (or protein). Therefore, it is necessary to develop a comprehensive method that can be used in multiple scenarios and focuses on candidate order.In this study, we propose a method called NerLTR-DTA that uses the neighbor relationship of similarity and sharing to extract features, and applies a ranking framework with regression attributes to predict affinity values and priority order of query drug (or query target) and its related proteins (or compounds). It is worth noting that using the characteristics of learning to rank to set different queries can smartly realize the multi-scenario application of the method, including the discovery of new drugs and new targets. Experimental results on two commonly used datasets show that NerLTR-DTA outperforms some state-of-the-art competing methods. NerLTR-DTA achieves excellent performance in all application scenarios mentioned in this study, and the rm(test)2 values guarantee such excellent performance is not obtained by chance. Moreover, it can be concluded that NerLTR-DTA can provide accurate ranking lists for the relevant results of most queries through the statistics of the association relationship of each query drug (or query protein). In general, NerLTR-DTA is a powerful tool for predicting drug--target associations and can contribute to new drug discovery and drug repurposing.The proposed method is implemented in Python and Java.

Alternative measures such as positive predictive value (PPV) and the associated Precision/Recall (PRC) plots are used less frequently. Many bioinformatics studies develop and evaluate classifiers that are to be applied to strongly imbalanced datasets in which the number of negatives outweighs the number of positives significantly. While ROC plots are visually appealing and provide an overview of a classifier's performance across a wide range of specificities, one can ask whether ROC plots could be misleading when applied in imbalanced classification scenarios. We show here that the visual interpretability of ROC plots in the context of imbalanced datasets can be deceptive with respect to conclusions about the reliability of classification performance, owing to an intuitive but wrong interpretation of specificity. PRC plots, on the other hand, can provide the viewer with an accurate prediction of future classification performance due to the fact that they evaluate the fraction of true positives among positive predictions. Our findings have potential implications for the interpretation of a large number of studies that use ROC plots on imbalanced datasets.},

  abstract = {Drug--target interaction (DTI) prediction is a crucial step in drug discovery and repositioning as it reduces experimental validation costs if done right. Thus, developing in-silico methods to predict potential DTI has become a competitive research niche, with one of its main focuses being improving the prediction accuracy. Using machine learning (ML) models for this task, specifically network-based approaches, is effective and has shown great advantages over the other computational methods. However, ML model development involves upstream hand-crafted feature extraction and other processes that impact prediction accuracy. Thus, network-based representation learning techniques that provide automated feature extraction combined with traditional ML classifiers dealing with downstream link prediction tasks may be better-suited paradigms. Here, we present such a method, DTi2Vec, which identifies DTIs using network representation learning and ensemble learning techniques. DTi2Vec constructs the heterogeneous network, and then it automatically generates features for each drug and target using the nodes embedding technique. DTi2Vec demonstrated its ability in drug--target link prediction compared to several state-of-the-art network-based methods, using four benchmark datasets and large-scale data compiled from DrugBank. DTi2Vec showed a statistically significant increase in the prediction performances in terms of AUPR. We verified the "novel" predicted DTIs using several databases and scientific literature. DTi2Vec is a simple yet effective method that provides high DTI prediction performance while being scalable and efficient in computation, translating into a powerful drug repositioning tool.},

The strenght of these approaches is illustrated on the reconstruction of metabolic, protein-protein and regulatory networks of model organisms. In all cases, state-of-the-art performance is reported.},

  abstract = {Identifying drug--target interactions (DTIs) is an important part of drug discovery and development. However, identifying DTIs is a complex process that is time consuming, costly, long, and often inefficient, with a low success rate, especially with wet-experimental methods. Computational methods based on drug repositioning and network pharmacology can effectively overcome these defects. In this paper, we develop a new fusion method, called FPSC-DTI, that fuses feature projection fuzzy classification (FP) and super cluster classification (SC) to predict DTI. As the experimental result, the mean percentile ranking (MPR) that was yielded by FPSC-DTI achieved 0.043, 0.084, 0.072, and 0.146 on enzyme, ion channel (IC), G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), and nuclear receptor (NR) datasets, respectively. And the AUC values exceeded 0.969 over all four datasets. Compared with other methods, FPSC-DTI obtained better predictive performance and became more robust.},
